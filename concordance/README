This software allows you to program your Logitech Harmony remote using a
configuration object retreived from the harmony website:
  http://members.harmonyremote.com/

The website is required. The website is required in Logitech's software as
well, it's just that their software wraps the website. Their website has
all the logic on what codes work with what remotes and what hardware, etc.
The software just takes the binary blobs that the website makes and writes
it to the remote control. This is true for both Logitech's software and
this software.

However, this software has some extra functionality such as being able to
dump (backup) your existing config, being cross-platform, and giving you
extra visibility into what's actually happening with your remote.

Here is how you use this software:

NOTE TO MAC USERS: You need to use 'sudo' since you don't have udev.

NOTE TO LINUX USERS: This assumes you have proper udev support setup
(see the INSTALL.Linux file in the libconcord source). If not, you'll
need to use sudo or be root.

NOTE TO LINUX USERS OF HARMONY 700: You need a kernel patch you can find here:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3011845&group_id=201579&atid=978130
It will be included in 2.6.36.

0. I got a file from the website, do something useful with it.

  $ concordance <filename>

This will attempt to figure out what to do, and do it. Note that the update
process sends TWO files: a connectivity test and the update. You will need
to do both.

1. Backup the config

  $ concordance --dump-config=/tmp/config.EZHex

This will read the config off of your remote and write it to /tmp/config.EZHex.
It's a good tool for development as well as backing up your config. This can
however be created from the members.harmonyremote.com website. The equals
is needed if you pass in a filename since the filename is optional. If
you don't specify, concordance will use 'config.EZHex' in the current directory.

2. Connectivity test

Go to members.harmonyremote.com, and when you're ready, choose "Update My
Remote." Before Logitech provides an actual config, they will first attempt to
do a connectivity test. Downloaded the Connectivity.EZHex file, and then run
the test:

  $ concordance Connectivity.EZHex

If that doesn't work, you can tell concordance what it is manually:

  $ concordance --connectivity-test Connectivity.EZHex

3. Write a config

Once the connectivity test is successfully completed, the site will prompt you
to download the actual config in a file called Update.EZHex. Save it and then
you can use it with:

  $ concordance Update.EZHex

Again, concordance should do the right thing here, but in case of problems you
can explicitly tell concordance what to do with:

  $ concordance --write-config Update.EZHex

4. Backup the firmware

Sometimes the site will want to update your firmware. Concordance allows you to
backup your old firmware so you may later revert if you prefer. You can do this
with:

  $ concordance --dump-firmware

This will read the firmware off of your remote and write it to fimrware.EZHex.
See "1. Backup the config" for more information.

5. Write firmware

NOTE: This feature is only implemented for certain models. Please see:
  http://www.phildev.net/concordance/supported_models.shtml

However for models we support this on, it works like this:

  $ concordance Firmware.EZHex

Again, if you have a problem, you can tell concordance what to do explicitly:

  $ concordance --write-firmware Firmware.EZHex


There are other options - check out the --help one!
